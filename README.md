# Bot

Bot is a virtual assistant for Otofarma Spa, built using Python and Flask. It provides automated responses to user queries about Otofarmaâ€™s services, products, appointments, and more. The bot supports natural language questions in Italian and uses a YAML-based Q&A corpus, fuzzy matching, and dynamic responses for time and date. It also includes a Telegram bot version.

## Features

- Responds to user questions about Otofarma (services, products, appointments, etc.)
- Supports natural, conversational queries in Italian
- Dynamic responses for current time and date (in Italian)
- Fallback responses for unknown or out-of-scope questions
- YAML corpus for easy editing and extension of Q&A pairs
- Telegram bot support (optional)
- Spellchecking for improved user experience

```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/youruser/otofarma-bot.git
   cd otofarma-bot
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **(Optional) Set up environment variables or config files:**
   - If your app uses `config.json` for secrets, fill in the required fields (never commit real tokens to GitHub!).

## Running Locally

```sh
python app.py
```
- The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:10000/` by default.

## Deployment (Render)

1. **Push your code to GitHub.**
2. **Connect your GitHub repo to [Render.com](https://render.com/).**
3. **Set up environment variables/tokens as needed in the Render dashboard.**
4. **Make sure your repo includes:**
   - `requirements.txt` (including `gunicorn`)
   - `Procfile` with: `web: gunicorn app:app`
   - `runtime.txt` with: `python-3.10.11`
5. **Deploy!**

## Customizing the Q&A

- Add/edit YAML files in `/corpus/` to teach the bot new answers.
